<div class="caution">

<strong>It is unsafe to write confidential text in a web
browser</strong> since JavaScript attacks can access it from inside
the browser. You should rather write your text in a separate
application, encrypt it using <span class="application">Tails OpenPGP
Applet</span>, and paste the encrypted text in your browser, before
sending it by email for example.

</div>

<div class="bug">

<p>When using <span class="application">Tails OpenPGP Applet</span> to encrypt emails, non-ASCII characters (for example non-Latin characters or characters
with accents) might not display correctly to the recipients of
the email.</p>

<p>If you are going to encrypt emails often, we recommend you to set up
[[Claws Mail|doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail/]] instead.</p>
