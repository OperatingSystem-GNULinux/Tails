[[!meta title="Verify the ISO image using OpenPGP"]]

<p>It is important to check the <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
Data_integrity desc="integrity"]]</span> of the ISO image you downloaded
to make sure that the download went well.</p>

<div class="caution">

<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and <span
class="definition">[[!wikipedia Certificate_authority desc="certificate
authorities"]]</span> to make you trust the content of this website.
But, [[as explained on our warning
page|doc/about/warning#man-in-the-middle]], you
could still be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS.
On this website as much as on any other of the Internet.</p>

<p>As a consequence, <strong>they don't provide you with a
strong way of checking the ISO image <span
class="definition">[[!wikipedia Authentication
desc="authenticity"]]</span> and making sure you downloaded a genuine
Tails.</strong> In a dedicated section, we will propose you some more advanced
techniques to <a href="#authenticity-check">check the authenticity of
the ISO image</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our
OpenPGP key.</strong>
OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
integrity.</p>

<p>If you already know how to use an OpenPGP key you can download it
straight away:</p>

<p>The Tails signing key that you downloaded from this website could
be a fake one if you were victim of a [[man-in-the-middle
attack|doc/about/warning#man-in-the-middle]].</p>

<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails signing key would allow you to
authenticate better the ISO image you downloaded. The following page
will give you hints on how to increase the trust you can put in the
Tails signing key you downloaded:</p>
