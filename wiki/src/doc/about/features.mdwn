Additional software
===================

You can
[[install additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]]
in Tails: all software packaged for Debian is installable in Tails.

Additional features
===================

* automatic mechanism to [[upgrade a USB stick or a SD card|doc/first_steps/upgrade]] to newer versions
* can be run as a virtualized guest inside
  [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) ([[More...|doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]])
* [[customization|contribute/customize]] (e.g. to add a given missing piece of
  software) is relatively easy: one may [[contribute/build]] a custom Amnesic
  Incognito Live System in about one hour on a modern desktop computer
* 64-bit PAE-enabled kernel with NX-bit and SMP support on hardware that supports it
* Some basic [[doc/first_steps/accessibility]] features
* Some [[contribute/design/application_isolation]] with AppArmor
* To prevent cold-boot attacks and various memory forensics, Tails
  erases memory on shutdown and when the boot media is physically
  removed.

Multilingual support
====================

When starting Tails, you can choose between a large number of languages, including Arabic,
Azerbaijani, Catalan, Czech, Welsh, Danish, German, Greek, English,
Spanish, Persian, Finnish, French, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian,
Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Latvian, Bokm√•l, Dutch, Polish,
Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovene, Albanian, Serbian, Swedish,
Turkish, Ukrainian, and Chinese.

The required keyboard input system is automatically enabled.

Some of these languages could not be thoroughly tested as we don't
speak every language in the world. If you find issues using one of the
supposedly supported languages, don't hesitate to [[tell us about
it|support]]. E.g. Tails probably lacks some non-Latin fonts
or input systems.

If you wish to make it easier to use Tails for your language speakers,
see the [[translators guidelines|contribute/how/translate]].
