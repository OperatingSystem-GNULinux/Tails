[[!meta title="Disabling all networking (offline mode)"]]

If you want to work completely offline, you can disable all networking
when starting Tails for additional security. Doing so can be useful to work on
sensitive documents.

To disable all networking:

1. When [[<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>|startup_options#tails_greeter]] appears, in the
   <span class="guilabel">Welcome to Tails</span> window, click on the
   <span class="button">Yes</span> button. Then click on the
   <span class="button">Forward</span> button.

2. In the <span class="guilabel">Network configuration</span> section, select
   the <span class="guilabel">Disable all networking</span> option.
