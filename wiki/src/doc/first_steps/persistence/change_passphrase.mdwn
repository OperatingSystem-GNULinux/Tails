[[!meta title="Change the passphrase of the persistent volume"]]

  1. While starting Tails, [[set up an administration password
     |doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].

  1. Open <span class="application">Disks</span> from the menu
     <span class="menuchoice">
       <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guisubmenu">Utilities</span>&nbsp;▸
       <span class="guimenuitem">Disks</span></span>.

     <span class="application">Disks</span> lists all the current storage
     devices in the left pane of the window. When you select one of these devices,
     detailed information about it is displayed in the right pane: its partitions,
     its brand, its size, etc.

  1. Find which device contains the persistent volume. It should have
     two partitions, one labelled <span class="guilabel">Tails</span>, and another
     one labelled <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> which corresponds to the persistent volume.

  1. In the right pane, click on the persistent volume partition,
     labelled <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span>.

  1. Click on <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/system-run.png alt="Disks context menu" class="symbolic" link="no"]]</span>
     and choose <span class="guilabel">Change Passphrase…</span>.

  1. Type your current passphrase and then type twice a new one.

  1. Finally confirm by clicking <span class="guilabel">Change</span>.

  1. In the confirmation dialog, enter your administration password and click
     <span class="guilabel">Authenticate</span>.

  1. You now can restart Tails and try to enable the persistent volume
     with its new passphrase.
