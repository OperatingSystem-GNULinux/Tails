"*Tor Browser* 4.5 protects better against **third-party tracking**. Often "
"when visiting a website, many connections are created to transfer both the "
"content of the main website (its page, images, and so on)  and third-party "
"content from other websites (advertisements, *Like* buttons, and so on). In "
"*Tor Browser* 4.5, all such content, from the main website as well as the "
"third-party websites, goes through the same Tor circuits. And these circuits "
"are not reused when visiting a different website. This prevents third-party "
"websites from correlating your visits to different websites."
