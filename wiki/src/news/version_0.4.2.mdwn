Amnesia 0.4.2 released

This new release is mainly aimed at fixing a live-initramfs [[security
issue|security/use_of_untrusted_Live_system_found_on_local_hard-disk]],
with an additional set of small enhancements as a bonus:

* Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)
* APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net
* Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed the compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to
    wait for the Live media to be ready

See the [online
Changelog](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.4.2)
