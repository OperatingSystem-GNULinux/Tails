"  * Major new features\n"
"    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 4.5, which introduces many major new\n"
"      features for usability, security and privacy. Unfortunately its\n"
"      per-tab circuit view did not make it into Tails yet since it\n"
"      requires exposing more Tor state to the user running the Tor\n"
"      Browser than we are currently comfortable with.\n"
"      (Closes: [[!tails_ticket 9031]])\n"
"    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.6.7-1~d70.wheezy+1+tails2. Like in the Tor\n"
"      bundled with the Tor Browser, we patch it so that circuits used\n"
"      for SOCKSAuth streams have their lifetime increased indefinitely\n"
"      while in active use. This currently only affects the Tor Browser\n"
"      in Tails, and should improve the experience on certain websites\n"
"      that otherwise would switch language or log you out every ten\n"
"      minutes or so when Tor switches circuit.  (Closes:\n"
