"Tails 2.0 will be the first version of Tails based on DebianÂ 8 (Jessie). As "
"such, it upgrades essentially all included software."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The most noticeable change is probably the move to GNOME Shell, configured "
"in *Classic mode*. This desktop environment provides a modern and actively "
"developed replacement for the aging GNOME \"Flashback\".  GNOME Shell also "
"paves the way for better supporting touchscreens in the future."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Under the hood, an amazing amount of code was ported to more modern "
"technologies. This, in turn, allowed us to do lots of small changes all "
"around the place, that will make the Tails experience both safer, and more "
"pleasant. For example, all custom system services are harder to exploit "
"thanks to the use of Linux namespaces, set up by systemd. And the way Tails "
"tells the user that \"Tor is ready\" is now more accurate."
