Amnesia 0.4.1 released

Highlighted changes:

* We now ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
  burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.
* We now ship multilingual ISO images; initially supported (or rather
  wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it, pt, es.
* Icedove was replaced with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
  [[todo/replace_icedove_with_claws]] for best practices and
  configuration advices.
* Virtual keyboard:  kvkbd was replaced with onBoard.
* Tor controller: TorK was replaced with Vidalia.
* Anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting is now made easy, thanks to
  [WhisperBack](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git).
* Users are now warned at runtime when the amnesia version they are
  running is affected by security flaws, and which ones they are.

See the [online
Changelog](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.4.1)
for details.
