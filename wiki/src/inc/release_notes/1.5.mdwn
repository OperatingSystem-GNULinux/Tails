## New features

  - **Disable access to the local network** in the *Tor Browser*. You
    should now use the *Unsafe Browser* to access the local network.

## Upgrades and changes

  - Install *Tor Browser* 5.0 (based on Firefox 38esr).
  - Install a *32-bit GRUB EFI boot loader*. Tails should now start on
    some tablets with Intel Bay Trail processors among others.
  - Let the user know when *Tails Installer* has rejected a device
    because it is too small.

## Fixed problems

  - Our *AppArmor* setup has been audited and improved in various ways
    which should harden the system.
  - The network should now be properly disabled when *MAC address
    spoofing* fails.
