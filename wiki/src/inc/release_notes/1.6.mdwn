There are numerous other changes that might not be apparent in the daily
operation of a typical user. Technical details of all the changes

## Fixed problems

  - Fix several issues related to *MAC address spoofing*:
    * If MAC address spoofing fails on a network interface and
      this interface cannot be disabled, then all networking is now
      completely disabled.
    * A notification is displayed if MAC address spoofing causes network
      issues, for example if a network only allows connections from a
      list of authorized MAC addresses.
