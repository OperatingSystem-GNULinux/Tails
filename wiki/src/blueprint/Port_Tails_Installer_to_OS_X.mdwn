# Introduction

This is an on-going feasibility on how to port the Tails Installer to the Mac OS X operating system.

## Considerations

This feasibility study was done on a OS X El Capitan system on an early 2011 Macbook. Stock Python2.7 was used.

## Porting

liveusb-creator from Fedora(upstream) only works out of the box for Windows and Linux but no efforts were brought in to support OS X. This is an action point.

## Packaging

This section dives into packaging it all together.

### GTK bundling

* [GTK Mac Bundler ](https://github.com/twstrike/gtk-mac-bundler)
* [Micah Lee's attempt at GTK and Onionshare (he switched to QT)](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/issues/43)

### Codesigning

We could either:

- Get our software signed and be in the Mac App Store.
- Ask people to download from our website and install doing Ctrl+Click as [instructed for *Tor Browser*|https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en].

* [Apple's Security Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/Security_Overview/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000976)
* [Apple's Code Signing introduction](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html)
