[[!meta title="Tails report for June, 2015"]]

[[Tails 1.4.1|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/calendar]] has been postponed (because Firefox changed their schedule) and will be released sometime in the beginning of July. So once again, this report will give non-code news :)

[[!toc]]

Documentation and Website
=========================

* We added a warning in the [[OpenPGP app documentation|https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet]] about non-ASCII characters being badly supported.

* A small note about non-free firmware was added to our [[licence page|https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/license]].

User Experience
===============

* People are working on the [[Greeter mockups|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-June/000437.html]].

FIXME more ?

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 185 scenarios, 3 more that in May. We removed outdated scenario again, so there are more than 3 new tests :)

* We decided to archive publicly the tails-support mailing list, since external websites were archiving it anyway.

* FIXME more?

Funding
=======

* If you want to help us develop and maintain Tails, please [[donate|https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/donate]] :)

Outreach
========

* [[A workshop about Tails|http://www.lacantine-brest.net/event/atelier-datalove-tails-x-tor/]] happened in Brest, France, June 18th.

* Tchou and Fiodor Tonti gave [[a talk about Tails and UX|https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/programme/2015/jeudi-18-juin/grande-salle/atelier-design-tails]] in Pas Sage en Seine 2015 at NUMA in Paris, France on June 18th. [[The video is online|https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/archives-et-videos/]] and good feedback already arrived :)

* [[A workshop about Tor and Tails|https://jardin-entropique.eu.org/ateliers]] happened in Rennes, France, during the Jardin entropique event, June 28th.

Upcoming events
---------------

* A talk about Tails will take place during [[DebConf15|http://debconf15.debconf.org/]] in Heidelberg, Germany, in August.

* Please let us know if you organize an event about Tails, we'll be glad to announce it :)

On-going discussions
====================

* [[We discussed our release versioning|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009132.html]] and found a new way to do it: always increment the first number with major Debian version, or whenever it makes sense for Tails only (user-visible changes); second number: even for bugfix releases, odd for major ones; add an extra 3rd number for emergency releases.

* intrigeri started a discussion about [[tightening a bit the Evince and Totem AppArmor policy|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009007.html]].

* genghiskant proposed [[making a fork of Tails without non-free firmware|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009023.html]].

* We're talking about the design of a [[persistent Tor state|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009095.html]].

* We're also discussing the [[automated tests specification|https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009123.html]].

Press and testimonials
======================

* 2015-06-20: In [The state of encryption tools, 2 years after Snowden leaks](https://www.dailydot.com/politics/encryption-since-snowden-trending-up/) Patrick Howell O'Neill from the Daily Dot studies the adoption rate of encryption tools such as Tor, Tails, and OpenPGP since the beginning of the Snowden revelations.
