[[!meta title="Tails report for June, 2015"]]

Tails 1.4.1 has been postponed (because Mozilla changed their release schedule) and was released in the beginning of July. So once again, this report will give non-code news :)

[[!toc]]

Releases
========

* The next release (1.5) is [[planned for August 11|contribute/calendar/]].

* We decided on a new [[version number scheme|contribute/release_schedule#versioning]].

Documentation and website
=========================

* A small note about non-free firmware was added to our [[licence page|doc/about/license]].

* Our [[documentation for reviewers|contribute/merge_policy/review]] now explains how to do a good and nice review.

* We warn that *Tails OpenPGP Applet* can lead to
  [[encoding problems for emails|doc/encryption_and_privacy/gpgapplet/public-key_cryptography#encoding]].

User experience
===============

- On the [[Installation Assistant|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant]]:
  - We wrote a full synopsis of the [[installation process for
    Windows|blueprint/bootstrapping/assistant/windows]], submitted it for
    review, and started testing it ([[!tails_ticket 9202 desc="#9202"]]).
  - We started writing an ikiwiki and Bootstrap prototype of the Installation
    Assistant in [[!tails_gitweb_branch web/assistant]].

* People are working on the [Greeter mockups](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2015-June/000437.html).

Infrastructure
==============

* Our test suite covers 185 scenarios, 3 more that in May. We removed outdated scenario again, so there are more than 3 new tests :) New tests add coverage for the Tor Browser's _New Identity_ feature, the hardware clock not being saved. Additionally, a huge amount of work was put into making our test suite more robust.

* We decided to publicly archive the tails-support mailing list, since external websites were archiving it anyway.

* Great progress was made towards automatically [[!tails_ticket 6196 desc="building all active branches"]] on Jenkins. Live deployment is now a matter of days.

* We have [[!tails_ticket 8649 desc="specified"]] the requirements for our upcoming monitoring system.

Funding
=======

* If you want to help us develop and maintain Tails, please [[donate|contribute/how/donate]] :)

* We sent our final report for the Access Innovation Prize received in
  March 2014.

* We submitted our second quarterly report to the
  [Digital Defenders Partnership](https://digitaldefenders.org/).

Outreach
========

* Tchou and Fiodor Tonti gave [a talk about Tails and UX](https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/programme/2015/jeudi-18-juin/grande-salle/atelier-design-tails) in Pas Sage en Seine 2015 at NUMA in Paris, France on June 18th. [The video is online](https://www.passageenseine.org/fr/archives-et-videos/) and good feedback already arrived :)

Upcoming events
---------------

* A talk about Tails will take place during [DebConf15](http://debconf15.debconf.org/) in Heidelberg, Germany, in August.

* Please let us know if you organize an event about Tails, we'll be glad to announce it :)

On-going discussions
====================

* [We discussed our release versioning](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009132.html) and found a new way to do it: always increment the first number with major Debian version, or whenever it makes sense for Tails only (user-visible changes); second number: even for bugfix releases, odd for major ones; add an extra 3rd number for emergency releases.

* intrigeri started a discussion about [tightening a bit the Evince and Totem AppArmor policy](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009007.html).

* genghiskant proposed [making a fork of Tails without non-free firmware](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009023.html).

* We're talking about the design of a [persistent Tor state](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009095.html).

* We're also discussing the [automated tests specification](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-June/009123.html).

Press and testimonials
======================

* We gave an interview to Amaelle Guiton from
  [Lib√©ration](http://liberation.fr) about our relationship with the Tor
  ecosystem.

* We provided some data to Patrick Howell O'Neill from the Daily Dot for
  his article about [The state of encryption tools, 2 years after Snowden leaks](https://www.dailydot.com/politics/encryption-since-snowden-trending-up/).
