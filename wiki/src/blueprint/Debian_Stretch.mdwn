[[!meta title="Porting Tails to Debian Stretch"]]

This is about the effort to create [Tails
3.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=198),
based on Debian Stretch.

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Big picture

When porting to Wheezy, our main problem has been that we started the
work too late, which made us discover Debian bugs too late (after the
Debian Wheezy freeze, or even after its release), and in the end we
had to workaround lots of problems on our side.

So we started much earlier the porting work to Jessie, which indeed
essentially avoided the aforementioned problem. But we didn't allocate
enough focused resources to this effort, and as a result the total
duration of the porting to Jessie work is lasting too much, and we're
spending too much time just keeping our feature/jessie branch
up-to-date wrt. the changes we were making in our Wheezy
production branches.

For Stretch we'd like to avoid both problems. We want to start early,
in order to fix problems directly in Debian Stretch before it's
released. And, we want the porting work to fit into a shorter time
span, so as soon as we start we'll allocate more resources to it, and
in a better organized, team-based and focused way.

Additionally, we would like to use this process as an opportunity to
evaluate the idea of basing Tails on snapshots of Debian testing.

# Schedule

* 2016Q1 — Tails 2.0 is out
* April or May 2016 — start working on Tails 3.0 (1 week sprint with
  all involved people) :intrigeri:anonym:kytv:
  - get feature/stretch to build and boot
  - update the automated test suite to test Tails/Stretch ISO images
* May 2016 to April 2017 — have one dedicated half-time, 1-week sprint
  every 6 weeks.
  - Schedule these sprints in advance, announce them
    publicly, and invite other contributors (e.g. doc writers).
  - Most of these sprints will probably be attended remotely, but at
    least some could happen face-to-face.
  - At the beginning of each Stretch sprint, we import a new snapshot
    of Debian testing into our freezable APT repository, so that:
    * during the sprint we update our stuff as required by changes
      that happened in Debian since the last sprint;
    * our stuff is not broken by changes in Debian neither during
      sprints, nor between them;
    * we get a feeling of how "being based on snapshots of Debian
      testing" would work.
* December 5 2016 — Debian Stretch freeze starts
* April 2017 (???) — Debian Stretch is released
* April-June 2017 — Tails 3.0 is released

# Let's go rolling

Let's use this porting cycle to evaluate how being based on snapshots
of Debian testing would feel like. During the entire cycle:

* Keep the automated test suite up-to-date on feature/stretch :kytv:
* Keep the documentation up-to-date on feature/stretch :doc_writer:
* Take notes of issues we see from the perspective of "how would it go
  if we were based on testing already?". E.g.:
  - How to deal with ongoing transitions that block migration of
    security updates from sid to testing?

Note that during half of the cycle, we'll be based on a frozen Debian
testing, so the changes rate coming from Debian won't be crazy.
Of course there will be changes coming from our own porting efforts.

And then, once Tails 3.0 is out: we're not lagging behind anymore, and
are thus in a position to decide whether we want to base Tails on
snapshots of Debian testing.
