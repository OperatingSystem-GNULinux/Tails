# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

In May we discovered than Claws Mail is leaking plaintext of encrypted
emails to the IMAP server [1] and that it was impossible to fix this
properly in Tails. As a consequence, we're now considering moving to
Icedove faster than planned initially (late January) and to:

  - Replace Claws Mail with Icedove *without* its account creation
    wizard in Tails 1.7 (early November). TorBirdy already provides an
    alternative account wizard which is good enough for that step.
  - Add the wizard in Tails 1.9 (late January).

We also started prototyping tools for users to migrate their data from
Claws Mail to Icedove but nothing is published yet.

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.1. Automatically build ISO images for all the branches of our
        source code that are under active development

- B.1.9. Deploy, refresh our Jenkins jobs regularly

  After our code freeze for Tails 1.5, we realized that there was
  a bug in our algorithm that detects what Git branch should be built
  on Jenkins (#9925). We promptly worked around the
  problem initially, to not interfere with the release management work.
  And then, a proper fix was implemented and deployed.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9925

## B.2. Continuously run our entire test suite on all those ISO images
        once they are built

- B.2.1. Adjust our infrastructure to run tests in parallel (#9645, #9486)

  All the testing VMs we planned to deploy (four of them) are now live,
  and our test suite developers have access to them and can run the test
  suite there. They are connected to our Jenkins master, but have no
  jobs running on them yet. Our Puppet modules have been adapted to make
  this possible.

  Manual stress testing of these new systems is ongoing. It will allow
  us to see how our test suite behaves there, and how these systems cope
  with it.

  We still need to automate these test suite runs with Jenkins to have
  good statistics. It will also teach us whether we need to start a
  clean test VM before each test suite run. Ideas to implement this have
  been researched, evaluated, and discussed.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9645
  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9486

- B.2.2. Decide what kind of ISO images qualify for testing and when,
  how to process, advertise, and store the results (#8667)

  The discussion has almost reached its end, and the corresponding
  blueprint [2] is now essentially complete.  Now that this step is
  completed, we have clear design goals, and we know what will need to
  be done to deploy our automated test suite on our Jenkins
  infrastructure.

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

This covers "C.4.3. Administer our services upto milestone III" until
the end of August.

- We fixed the "reboot required" notifications on our Jessie and
  newer systems. The corresponding Puppet code was proposed upstream.
- We started adapting our Puppet code to migrate to Gitolite v3 (#10093).
- We experimented with http://httpredir.debian.org, with limited
  success so far. It should improve with the version of APT that will
  ship in Debian 9 (Stretch).
- We deployed to pre-production a meeting reminder system that should
  be more robust (#9172).
- We converted some obsolete service management we had to systemd.
- We installed the base system of the VM that was planned to be a
  failover for our critical services (#6250).

# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

Not much technical work in this area in August: we were busy attending
GUADEC and DebConf.

Still, aside of the achievements described below:

- We identified issues on Jessie with the AppArmor profile for CUPS
  (#9963). The Tails-specific part was corrected,
  and more generic maintainability issues were raised on the upstream
  mailing-list.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9963

- We identified a couple minor issues that we would like to address
  before the Tails 2.0 release (#9966, #9967), if time permits.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9966
  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9967

## D.1. Adjust to the change of desktop environment to GNOME Shell

- Regarding the not fully solved problem we have with desktop
  notifications (#7989): we asked for advice to
  a GNOME developer, and were pointed to a technical solution that
  seems to be exactly what we need.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/7989

## D.2. Take advantage of systemd to improve the internals of Tails

- D.2.2. Replace our patches to upstream initscripts with systemd
  drop-in overrides (#9881)

  We actually found a better solution to solve the underlying problem.
  The objective was to patch 9 initscripts maximum, and we are now
  modifying only 8.

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9881

## D.6. Upgrade Tails-specific tools to Debian Jessie technologies

- D.6.1. Port Tails-specific tools from udisks 1 to udisks 2

  We worked a bit on simple reproducers for the race conditions we are
  seeing in udisks (#9691).

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9691

- D.6.3. Port WhisperBack, our integrated bug reporting tool, to Python 3

  We fixed a bug caused by a typo, and made progress on adding native
  SOCKS support to WhisperBack (#9412).

  https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9412

# E. Release management

  - Tails 1.5 [3] was released on 2015-08-11

    - Disable access to the local network in the Tor Browser. Users
      should now use the Unsafe Browser to access the local network.
    - Install Tor Browser 5.0 (based on Firefox 38esr).
    - Install a 32-bit GRUB EFI boot loader. Tails now starts on some
      tablets with Intel Bay Trail processors and on some Mac with
      32-bit UEFI.
    - Let the user know when Tails Installer has rejected a device
      because it is too small.
    - Our AppArmor setup has been audited and improved in various ways
      which should harden the system.

  - Tails 1.5.1 [4] was released on 2015-08-28

    Tails 1.5.1 was an emergency release triggered by an unscheduled Firefox
    release meant to fix critical security issues.
