  * what was done
  * what is the outcome (how it makes Tails better)
  * what was not done, and why

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.2.1 Adjust our infrastructure to run tests in parallel: #9645,
   #9486

All the isotesters we planned to deploy (four of them) are now live, and
our test suite developpers have access to it to run the test suite on
them. They are connected to our Jenkins master, but do not have jobs
running on them yet. Our puppet modules have been adapted for their
deployment.

The test suite is actually run by hand regulary to see how it behaves
and how our system can cope with it.

We still need to automate this runs through Jenkins to have good
statistics. It will also help use to have an idea about whether we need
to fire a up a clean test VM before each test suite run. Ideas to
implement this have already been researched and discussed.

## B.2.2 Decide what kind of ISO images qualify for testing and when,
         how to process, advertise, and store the results: #8667

The discussion has reached its end, and the draft of the blueprint is
now done.
Now that this step is completed, we have a clear design and we know what
will need to be done to deploy our automated test suite.

# C. Scale our infrastructure


# D. Migration to Debian Jessie


# E. Release management
