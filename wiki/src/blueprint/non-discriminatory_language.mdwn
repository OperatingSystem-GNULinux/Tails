What's the problem
------------------

some ideas/suggestions:

*  Can we measure how severe the problem is? 

    ` find $WIKIPATH -name *.de.po -type f -exec \
     grep -ioE "Nutzer|Anwender|$MOREWORDS" '{}' \; | wc -l `

   That could allow us to decide whether we have an urgent problem in
   our documentation that needs to be addressed in general, or whether
   it occurs only in a few places that can be fixed manually by
   slightly twisting the language.

*  Via the same approach as we handle other translation issues: How do
   other wikis/translations handle the same problem? Like TorProject,
   GNOME, Debian, Wikipedia,...  What would be the "official" (Duden?)
   way to do it? (for comparison)

*  Other languages are not gender neutral as well. How is it handled in
   the French/$MORELANG translation?
   Of course it is difficult to compare "good" and "bad" languages with
   regard to gender neutrality, and every language needs a mechanism to
   express/discriminate between, for instance, gender where it is
   necessary for understanding.

*  It should be decided what we want to achieve: non-discrimination
   between which groups?  A candidate/idea for a solution should again
   be evaluated for this aspect.  For instance if we decided to use
   "Benutzerinnen und Benutzer" consistently, we might accidentially
   exclude all groups that don't want themselves to be categorised to
   male or female.  We could bite the bullet and accept that we cannot
   fix natural/spoken languages and need to take a feasible option.
   Another approach could be to only remove/replace words (versus
   adding them) to make the language less specific, and thus, less
   discriminating. (On the other hand, there are some people that are
   very effective in saying nothing with a lot of words.)

Examples of sentences and their german translation
--------------------------------------------------

"Das Hauptziel einer Fehlerbeschreibung ist es, den Entwicklern genau
zu sagen wie der Fehler reproduziert werden kann." from the bug
reporting page. In this situation we could use "den Entwickelnden"
oder a gender gap "den Entwickler*Innen". The question is also how we
can maintain a good readability (for me personally a gender gap is not
a problem for readability, it's sort of a habituation thing).

Another example:
"Das Ziel dieser Dokumentation ist zu erklären, wie man Tails benutzt
und dem Nutzer die wesentlichen Sicherheitsfeatures darzustellen."
from the introduction page. In this one we could use "den Nutzenden",
but this sounds a bit weird. So maybe a gender gap fits more in here
or a completely different term.

Last example (there a a lot of them ;) I just picked some out quickly):
"Tor wird gleichermaßen von Journalisten, Strafverfolgungsbehörden,
Regierungen, Menschenrechtsaktivisten, Geschäftsführern, dem Militär,
Missbrauchsopfern und normalen Bürgern, die sich um ihre Privatsphäre
sorgen, benutzt." from  "Why does Tails use Tor?"
