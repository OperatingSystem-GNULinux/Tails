[[!meta title="CRM for frontdesk"]]

We want a tool that allows frontdesk to:
========================================

MUST
----

 - Track easily what's been done and what's left from previous shifts:
   - Make it easy to ensure everything is answered
   - Be able to follow an issue from the beginning to the end
 - Statistics:
   - Know how many users encountered the same issue. Spot the "Top bug".
   - Be able to have stats on common issues
 - Security of the platform:
   - Allow secure deletion of information over time. Not keep a database forever (how long? what to keep?)
   - Handle incoming OpenPGP emails
   - Handle outgoing OpenPGP emails
 - Be able to search into emails archive
 - Better interaction between user support and devs:
   - Provide logs to devs
   - Make it easy to drop more dev-related issues to devs
 - Provide a separate queue of tickets per language [[!tails_ticket 9080]]
 - Make it easy to get new mates on board
 - Keep a database of template answers

SHOULD
------

 - Make it easy to contact the user back when there is a solution
 - Hardware information
   - Parse cleverly WhisperBack data (hardware, gpg, etc)
   - Keep track of hardware compatibility (Tails works on XYZ, Wi-Fi card XYZ doesn't work)
 - Shift management:
   - Replace the calendar of shifts and do something smart about that (send notifications to the person on duty)
   - Automatically clock user support time
 - Allow tracking tails-support@ from the same interface
 - Replace the list of bad users. Flag them as nasty automatically
 - Allow forwarding issues from and to other user support projects (Tor, Access Now)
 - Allow users to express whether they were satisfied with our answers
 - Be configurable using Puppet

MAY
---

 - Have a disposable chat system for tricky cases (Tor does that)
