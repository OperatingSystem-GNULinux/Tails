[[!meta title="Tails report for July, 2015"]]

July started frenetically, with the postponed release on the 3rd. Then we had a Tails contributors meeting, and it was lots of fun and hard work. We decided broad directions for the incoming years, that you'll see in our [[Roadmap|https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap]]. We also reevaluated our processes and tools, and had a dance party. Tails contributors are ready to go on doing amazing work :)
