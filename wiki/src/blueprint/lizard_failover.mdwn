# Scope

The idea is to avoid blocking the release process and normal Tails
usage if lizard goes down. It's *not* meant to replace lizard for more
than a few weeks.

# Services

These are the services, among [[those we
run|contribute/working_together/roles/sysadmins]], that we want
a failover for. This is inspired by the [[priority list for service
monitoring|blueprint/monitor_servers#services]].

- APT repository (our own one + the freezable Debian one)
- bittorrent
- Gitolite + git-annex for our Tor Browser archive
- rsync server
- WhisperBack relay

# System requirements

This is about [[!tails_ticket 10243]].

The goal is to specify what we'll likely need mid-2016.
We also need datacenter-class bandwidth.

- APT repository:
  * CPU: reprepro can already be hungry; and once we have the
    freezable APT repo, depending on the chosen tools it may grow
    a lot (e.g. no idea how aptly behaves)
  * RAM: currently low, but might grow for the same reason as CPU usage
  * storage: 425 GB, +25% each year
- bittorrent:
  * CPU: low
  * RAM: low
  * storage: 3 GB
- Tor Browser archive:
  * CPU: low
  * RAM: low
  * storage: 60 GB, +40GB each year
- rsync server:
  * CPU: low
  * RAM: low
  * storage: 5 GB (excluding `obsolete`; 20 GB including it)
- WhisperBack relay:
  * CPU: low
  * RAM: low
  * storage: low

**Total**:

  * CPU: currently low but must be easily upgradable
  * RAM: 2 GB should be enough for now, but must be easily upgradable
  * storage: 500 GB mid-2016; 650 GB mid-2017
