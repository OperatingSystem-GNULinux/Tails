This is about [[!tails_ticket 5976]].

Persistence of client certificates and CAs in the browser would make their use a lot easier.

What should be saved
====================

The same approach than with bookmarks seems to be working, and we would need to persist the `cert8.db` file, which is the NSS database used to store CA and certificate information in general (this file stores all your security certificate settings and any SSL certificates you have imported into Firefox.)

(It was considered at some point to switch to key4 and cert9, but it never happened for Firefox desktop)

How can we save it?
===================

A new persistence option needs to be created, to allow the persistence of browser certificates and CAs. It will need to do a `bind-mount` of the persisted files. This needs to be done in the "live-boot" debian project.
