[[!meta title="Revamp the Greeter UI"]]

**Ticket**: [[!tails_ticket 5464 desc="#5464"]]

[[!toc levels=3]]

Rationale
=========

tails-greeter works fine, and its code in not that bad anymore, so on
this side it's now feasible to add features (e.g. [[!tails_ticket
5421]], [[!tails_ticket 5479]]).

However, the greeter UI is difficult to use, and adding more options
in the current state of things would only make things worse
usability-wise.

So, we have to improve the greeter UI to make it more ergonomic and
easier to use.

Current proposal
================

After working on a prototype and do UX testing with Numa people, we arrived to
the idea of two main flows:

- a quick setup for regular users;
- a wizard to guide newcomers

The result of this step can be found in [[NUMA_flow]].

We refined this on the *tails-ux* mailing list to arrive to a concrete proposal
for the 1st screen.

Mockup: [[https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/attachments/20150729/b774d708/attachment-0001.png]]

**TODO** write here a summary of the decisions and of the flow of the greeter,
including what happens when some parameters are saves.

Next steps
==========

Roadmap:

* document design of the 1st screen and ask for comments.
* implement UI in glade and integrate into the greeter
* design the wizard
