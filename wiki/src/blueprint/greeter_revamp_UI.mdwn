[[!meta title="Revamp the Greeter UI"]]

**Ticket**: [[!tails_ticket 5464 desc="#5464"]]

[[!toc levels=3]]

Rationale
=========

Tails-greeter works fine, and its code in not that bad anymore, so on
this side it's now feasible to add features (e.g. [[!tails_ticket
5421]], [[!tails_ticket 5479]]).

However, the greeter UI is difficult to use, and adding more options
in the current state of things would only make things worse
usability-wise.

So, we have to improve the greeter UI to make it more ergonomic and
easier to use.

Current proposal
================

After working on a prototype and doing UX testing with NUMA [[http://en.numa.paris/]], we arrived at the idea of having two main Tails-greeter flows:

- a quick setup for veteran users
- a guided setup for new users

The result of this can be found in the [[NUMA_flow]].

We refined this on the *tails-ux* mailing list to arrive at a concrete proposal for the first screen: [[design_rationale_phase1]].

The wizard is less defined. See the bottom of [[NUMA_flow]].

Next steps
==========

Roadmap:

* finish documenting design of the 1st screen and ask for comments.
* implement UI in glade and integrate into the greeter
* design the wizard
