# Volunteers to handle "[Hole in the roof](https://labs.riseup.net/code/versions/198)" tickets this month

- People have not much time to work on this.
- sycamoreone will work on the randomness generation problems and talk about it with DrWhax.
- MoC will ask somebody about [[!tails_ticket 7052]]

# Important tickets flagged for next release but without assignee

- [[!tails_ticket 9671]] will be taken by anonym -  we agreed on reverting the fancy inlining of stuff, and instead linking to release notes.
- [[!tails_ticket 9654]] anonym and, killytv will handle this one

# Availability for LHF

Around 4 people (sajolida, KillYourTV, emmapeel and MoC) will be around
for Aug 12th so it is confirmed

# Availability for the month

- lots of travelling to meetings, like  DebCamp+DebConf, CCCamp
- also work on the translation platform will continue

# [[!tails_ticket 7494  desc="Rename ISO and signature"]]

We had a look at the files in the Windows Vista file manager but there is still more information needed, as we want to know how this change in the filenames will affect other operating systems, so we will try the new renaming schemes on different OS and take screenshots and see how they will look if we add more words to the filename

# [[!tails_ticket 8828 desc="Distribute a copy of UUI from our website"]]

This work is only needed while we don't have the multiplatorm installer, once [[!tails_ticket 7544]] is done this will not be needed anymore

Maybe a cheap solution (UUI in a git repo, sajolida will look onto it) will be easy to implement until [[!tails_ticket 7544 ]]

We talked about maybe using the opportunity for testing UUI install as part of the release process, but there were no volunteers so we dropped the idea (we never did yet)

The plan is that tails-sysadmins we would set up a Git repo + additional
ikiwiki overlay, that sajolida would manually update every month or so,
without first testing the newly imported UUI.
