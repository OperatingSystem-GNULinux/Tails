    infrastructure, and importing the Farsi translations.

    donation of the end of the year, and other fundraising.

# [[!tails_ticket 10257 desc="Discuss & adopt a strategy to merge commits from Weblate"]]

We realized that this was highly dependent on the way we could implement a
review process inside Weblate which was something in the original list of
requirements ("MUST: provide user roles (admin, reviewer, translator"). We
created a ticket to investigate this [[!tails_ticket 10331 desc="#10331"]].

# [[!tails_ticket 10179 desc="Document mentors for new contributors"]]

We agreed on creating a dedicated page for that and linking it close to the
[[Easy tasks|contribute/easy_tasks]], probably as a new H3 headers under "Tools
for contributors".

# [[!tails_ticket 10024 desc="Document issues behind having Tails derivatives"]]

We reviewed the draft by sajolida. Other examples were mentioned such as
supporting other cryptcurrencies or different pluggable transports.
