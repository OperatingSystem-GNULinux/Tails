# A. Replace Claws Mail with Icedove

  - A.1.3. Integrate Icedove into Tails

    We configured Icedove in Tails to match our security goals (#6151),
    as part of this we disabled:

      - The remote email account feature (#10009)
      - The automatic add-on updates (#10428)

    We adapted Torbirdy to suit our needs in Tails. (#10007)

    During this work we discovered a bug in Torbirdy sometimes
    choosing a wrong language, which we patched upstream. Once our
    patch was merged, we updated the Torbirdy Debian package to a new
    version which we could also include in Tails. (#9821)

  - A.1.4. Provide a migration path for our users from Claws Mail to Icedove

    We studied the most common Claws Mail persistence configuration
    (#9494, #5663), then provided a script (#10453) to migrate POP
    mailboxes to Icedove and wrote
    [migration instructions](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/claws_mail_to_icedove/)
    (#9495) for users to migrate their mailboxes, email account
    settings, and address books.

    To make this migration easier to users, we enabled automatically the
    Icedove persistence feature when the Claws Mail persistence was
    enabled (#9498) and temporarily added the `nmh` package to Tails.

  - A.1.5. Update Icedove documentation

    The previous Thunderbird documentation was [completely
    rewritten](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/icedove/). (#7158)

  - A.1.6. Release Icedove in Tails

    Icedove has been added to Tails 1.7. (#10285)

    It is advertised as a technology preview in our
    [release notes](https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.7/). We want
    to have some more advanced users test our configuration and the
    migration process before we make Icedove the default email client
    and remove Claws Mail.

# B. Improve our quality assurance process

## B.1. Automatically build ISO images for all the branches of our source code that are under active development

We installed the GlobalBuildStat Jenkins plugin back in February, which helps
us collect the number of ISO images successfully built automatically by our
servers since the deployment of the automatic ISO builds:

- 2015-07: 101
- 2015-08: 195
- 2015-09: 470
- 2015-10: 935

## B.2. Continuously run our entire test suite on all those ISO images once they are built

- B.2.3. Research and design a solution to generate a set of Jenkins ISO test jobs

  Early in October we finally settled to the best option we found to
  reboot the VM between each run of the test suite in Jenkins (#9486).

  We finished evaluating the solution set up last month to share
  artifacts between the build jobs and the corresponding test jobs,
  and concluded that it works correctly. (#9597)

  We had to upgrade our jenkins-job-builder setup to the new 1.3.0 version,
  which was required to configure some Jenkins plugins our test jobs need. (#9646)

  We also pushed upstream a patch to handle the CucumberTestResult Jenkins
  plugin, so that we can easily use it in our setup and have a nice display of
  Cucumber reports. It has been merged and will be released with
  jenkins-job-builder 1.4.0: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/218668/>.

  We worked together with the test suite team on getting video artifacts
  for failing scenarios of a test job stored so that we could better debug. (#10154)

  With all this, we were able to deploy automated tests of ISO builds
  automatically for our main release branches at the end of the first week of
  October, which helped us confirm our design was working. (#10117)

  <https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/automated_builds_and_tests/jenkins/>

- B.2.4. Deploy the best solution from this research

  With this first initial and limited deployment, we corrected some tiny
  configuration details we didn't catch during the design step. (#10215, #10417)

  We stumbled upon a bug due to hardware or kernel troubles with nested
  virtualization we had to workaround. (#10229)

  It also helped us fix some issues in the integration of our test
  in the Jenkins environment. (#10356, #10359)

- B.2.5. Write library code that maps Jenkins jobs from building to testing

  Now that we had a good example of how to manage a test job with our
  jenkins-job-builder setup, triggered by its upstream build job, we
  adapted our code that generates build jobs for active branches to
  output their corresponding test jobs. We also ended up using the power
  of a more recent jenkins-job-builder version to simplify
  this code quite a lot. (#10118, #10119)

  It was already clear that we wouldn't be able to notify the
  committers on test suite failures at first, as the number of false
  positives was too high, and we didn't want to train them to ignore
  such notifications. So we planned a first iteration during which
  only the test suite team would receive notifications upon failure,
  so that they'll be able to work on the remaining tests being too
  fragile. (#10287)

  By October 15th, we had the automated test deployed live in Jenkins
  for all active branches. However, we quickly understood that our Git
  branches based on our maintenance one were too old to run the test
  suite in Jenkins correctly. These topic branches were mainly
  documentation ones so we could turn off their automated testing
  temporarily (this could be reverted once Tails 1.7 was released).

  According to the GlobalBuildStat Jenkins plugin, in the second half of
  October, our Jenkins instance ran the test suite 240 times.

  We're also discussing on our public mailing list whether it makes sense to
  run our whole test suite on ISO images built from
  documentation branches. (#10492)


## B.3. Extend the coverage of our test suite

  - B.3.5. Write tests for I2P

    Basic I2P functionality and configuration that is important in the
    context of Tails is now tested (#6306):

    <https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/features/i2p.feature?h=stable>

    This was part of Milestone II (July 15, 2015).

  - B.3.6. Fix newly identified issues to make our test suite more robust
           and fast enough to be part of a continuous integration process

    A plan was devised to leverage out automated testing
    infrastructure for identifying robustness issues is our test suite, and isolating
    them into separate branches, where they can be dealt with in
    isolation. (#10288)

    Other improvements:

    * The new snapshot system improved robustness noticeably, and
      reduced the amount of time needed for a full run with at least
      30%. (#6094)

    * Restart Tor if bootstrapping stalls for too long.

      This started out as a robustness improvement in the test suite,
      since many tests failed randomly due to Tor. We then implemented
      it as a feature in Tails, since it arguably should improve the
      user experience too (#9516).

  - B.3.9. Optimize tests that need a persistent volume

    The new snapshot system was finished early (part of Milestone IV,
    January 15, 2015). (#6094, #8008)

  - B.3.13. Split the "various checks" feature

    Started early, but not finished; so far only `mat.feature` and
    `localization.feature` have been created from split out
    scenarios. Thanks to #6094 the remainder of this work will be
    trivial.

  - Some other new tests that were written:

    * Write initial Icedove tests. (#10332)

    * Write a test for the fix of a symlink attack. It was added at
      the same time as the fix, and this is the ideal workflow we hope
      to be ready to adopt soon. (#10333)

  - Some improvements for test suite developers:

    * Organize automated test suite artifacts in per-run directories,
      and improve the naming so that it's easier to see e.g. which video
      belongs to which failed scenario. (#10151)

    * Clean up automated test suite dependencies. (#10208)

    * Force UTF-8 locale in automated test suite, to avoid implicitly
      relying on the system locales configuration. (#10359)

    * Run the automated test suite's VNC server forever. (#10345)

    * Don't print test suite information to STDERR, but use the
      Cucumber logging facilities so this information is included when
      logging to file. (#10342)

  - Bugs and regressions identified by our test suite

    We just started taking notes of them, so these records are
    probably not complete.

    * "Restart Tor if bootstrapping stalls for too long", mentioned
      above (#9516).
    * In September, implementing the automated MAC spoofing tests led
      us to notice that the MAC spoofing's panic mode was broken (#10160).

## B.4. Freezable APT repository

- B.4.1. Specify when we want to import foreign packages into which
  APT suites (#9488),
  B.4.4. Design freezable APT repository (#5926),
  and B.4.5. Implement processes and tools for importing and freezing
  those packages (#9487, #6295, #7427, #6906)

  Some initial research and experiments were conducted.

  The proposed design is described on a blueprint:
  <https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/freezable_APT_repository/>.

  A server-side implementation (#6296, #6299) has been drafted in the
  `tails::reprepro::snapshots::*` Puppet classes in the
  <https://git-tails.immerda.ch/puppet-tails/> module.

- B.4.2. Implement a mechanism to save the list of packages used at
  ISO build time (#6297)

  We have found ways to implement this, and have a working
  proof-of-concept, that now needs to be refined. This implied adding
  functionality we need to `debootstrap` upstream, and uploading
  a backport for Debian Jessie.

- B.4.6. Adjust the rest of our ecosystem to the freezable APT repository

  We adopted a documentation-driven approach, and started drafting
  documentation for the tools we will need to write:
  <https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/log/?h=feature/5926-freezable-APT-repository>.

# C. Scale our infrastructure

## C.1. Change in depth the infrastructure of our pool of mirrors

- C.1.2. Write & audit the code that makes the redirection decision

  Our prototype code (#8639) has been refined and will be adapted to work
  with our new installation assistant.

## C.2. Be able to detect within hours failures and malfunction on our services

- C.2.1. Research and decide what monitoring solution to use: #8645

  A little bit more research was done to ensure that our current best
  option will satisfy our needs.

## C.4. Maintain our already existing services

This covers "C.4.3. Administer our services upto milestone III" until
the end of October.

  * We kept on answering to the request from the community as well as taking
    care of security updates.
  * We had to reinstall one of our ISO builder VM that was failing too
    often. (#10334)
  * The OpenPGP key of our Debian repository was going to expire, so we had to
    update it. (#10419)
  * We thought a bit further how we could make our Jenkins instance public
    (#6270) which probably means to update to the packages provided by
    upstream. (#10068)

# D. Migration to Debian Jessie

## D. Migration to Debian Jessie

  - D.3.1 Update our test suite for Tails Jessie

    * Fix memory erasure tests in Debian Jessie. (#8317, #9705)

    * Work around screen blanking when testing Synaptic. (#10403)

    * Fix a robustness issue with the "Applications" menu
      handling. (#9706)
