<p>Tails documentation would greatly benefit from your help.</p>

Good documentation is difficult to keep up-to-date. If you find a typo
or an error in the documentation please let us know â€” ideally, by
submitting a patch with your correction.

# Writing

The documentation on the website is not freely editable. The way we
document things has serious security implications. People should be able
to trust the Tails website as much as they trust Tails itself.
Furthermore, every change in the documentation possibly breaks the
translations that were made of the previous version.

But there are still many ways you can start contributing:

  - We maintain a list of [documentation
    tasks](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=172).
    You can start writing a draft in the corresponding ticket and then
    [[ask us for review|contribute/talk]].

  - Small fixes and enhancements to the current documentation are
    greatly welcome. This can be done by sending Git patches to [[the
    tails-dev mailing list|contribute/talk]] or by publishing a
    [[Git]] branch (for example to a fork on
    [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Tails/tails)). In general,
    documentation changes should be based on the `master` branch.

Documentation writers coordinate themselves using our usual
[[development communication channels|contribute/talk]].

Documentation writers should also read our [[documentation
guidelines|guidelines]].

New documentation should be wrapped to 80 characters; however, please
do not submit patches that merely re-wrap existing text, as this makes
it harder to read the git history.

We recommend you to [[build an offline version of the
documentation|contribute/build/website]] to test your contributions
before sharing them with us.

# Tools

  - Images on our website are compressed and cleaned using the
    [[compress-image.sh]] script. To run this script you need the
    `optipng`, `advancecomp`, and `mat` packages.

  - To encode and decode QR codes, you can use the [[qrcode-encode.sh]]
    and [[qrcode-decode.sh]] scripts. To run these scripts
    you need to install the `qrencode` and `zbar-tools` packages.

    For example:

        qrcode-encode https://tails.boum.org/

    Creates a QR code in tails_boum_org.png. And:

        qrcode-decode tails_boum_org.png

    Outputs:

        QR-Code:https://tails.boum.org/

# Translating

We want Tails [[end-user documentation|doc]] to be translated in
as many languages as possible. See the [[guidelines for
translators|contribute/how/translate]] for details.
