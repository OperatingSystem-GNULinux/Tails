  - [[!debpts mat]]
  - [[!debpts nautilus-wipe]]
  - privacy-related packages in the [Debian Privacy Team](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/PkgPrivacyMaintainers)

  - [Hardening](https://wiki.debian.org/HardeningWalkthrough)
  - [Reproducible builds](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds)
* Set up automated QA of [Debian Live](http://live.debian.net/)
  development branches, and/or change the workflow of this project so
