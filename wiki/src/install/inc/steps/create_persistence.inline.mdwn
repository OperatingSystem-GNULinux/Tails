Create an encrypted persistent storage (optional)
=================================================

<div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/create-persistence.png link="no"]]</div>

You can optionally create an *encrypted persistent storage* in the
remaining free space on the
<span class="windows linux mac-usb">final</span>
<span class="clone">new</span>
Tails USB stick to store any of the following:

  - Your personal files and working documents
  - Some of your settings
  - Your encryption keys

The data in the encrypted persistent storage:

  - Remains available across separate working sessions.
  - Is encrypted using a passphrase of your choice.

<div class="caution">

<p>The encrypted persistent storage is not hidden. An attacker in possession of
the USB stick can know whether it has an encrypted persistent storage. Take into consideration
that you can be forced or tricked to give out its passphrase.</p>

</div>

<div class="caution">

<p>It is possible to
open the encrypted persistent storage from other operating systems, but it might break
your security.
Other operating systems should probably not be trusted to handle
sensitive information or leave no trace.</p>

</div>

Create the persistent storage
-----------------------------

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent volume</span></span>.

1. Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

   <div class="tip">
   <p>We recommend choosing a long passphrase made of five to seven random words.
   <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">Learn more.</a></p>
   </div>

1. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

   <div class="bug">
   <p>If you close the assistant before the creation finishes, you might
   not be able to start Tails from this USB stick anymore.</p>
   </div>

4. The assistant shows a list of the possible persistence features. Each
   feature corresponds to a set of files or settings to be saved in the encrypted
   persistent storage.

   We recommend you to only activate the <span class="guilabel">Personal
   Data</span> persistence feature for the time being. You
   can activate more features later on according to your needs.

5. Click <span class="button">Save</span>.

   <div class="step-image">[[!img install/inc/infography/restart-on-tails.png link="no"]]</div>

Restart and activate the persistent storage
-------------------------------------------

1. Shut down the computer and restart on the
   <span class="windows linux mac-usb">final</span>
   <span class="clone">new</span>
   Tails USB stick.

   - Select your preferred language in the drop-down list on the bottom
     left of the screen.
   - In the <span class="guilabel">Use persistence?</span> section,
     choose <span class="guilabel">Yes</span> to activate the encrypted
     persistent storage for the current working session.
   - Enter the passphrase of the persistent volume in the
     <span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> text box.</span>
   - Click <span class="button">Login</span>.
