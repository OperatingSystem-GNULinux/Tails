Feature: Installing packages through APT
  As a Tails user
  when I set an administration password in Tails Greeter
  I should be able to install packages using APT and Synaptic
  and all Internet traffic should flow only through Tor.

  Background:
    Given I have started Tails from DVD and logged in with an administration password and the network is connected

  Scenario: APT sources are configured correctly
    Then the only hosts in APT sources are "ftp.us.debian.org,security.debian.org,backports.debian.org,deb.tails.boum.org,deb.torproject.org,mozilla.debian.net"
