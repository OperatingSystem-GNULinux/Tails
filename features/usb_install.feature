Feature: Installing Tails to a USB drive
  As a Tails user
  I want to install Tails to a suitable USB drive

  Scenario: Try installing Tails to a too small USB drive
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    And I temporarily create a 2 GiB disk named "too-small-device"
    And I start Tails Installer in "Clone & Install" mode
    But a suitable USB device is not found
    When I plug USB drive "too-small-device"
    Then Tails Installer detects that a device is too small
    And a suitable USB device is not found
    When I unplug USB drive "too-small-device"
    And I create a 4 GiB disk named "big-enough"
    And I plug USB drive "big-enough"
    Then the "big-enough" USB drive is selected

  Scenario: Detecting when a target USB drive is inserted or removed
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in
    And I temporarily create a 4 GiB disk named "temp"
    And I start Tails Installer in "Clone & Install" mode
    But a suitable USB device is not found
    When I plug USB drive "temp"
    Then the "temp" USB drive is selected
    When I unplug USB drive "temp"
    Then no USB drive is selected
    And a suitable USB device is not found
