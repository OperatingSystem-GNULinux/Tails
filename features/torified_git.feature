  Scenario: Cloning a Git repository anonymously over HTTPS
    When I run "git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/myprivatekeyispublic/testing" in GNOME Terminal
    Then process "git" is running within 10 seconds
    And process "git" has stopped running after at most 180 seconds
    And the Git repository "testing" has been cloned successfully

  Scenario: Cloning git repository over SSH
    Given I have the SSH key pair for a Git repository
    When I run "git clone tails@git.tails.boum.org:myprivatekeyispublic/testing" in GNOME Terminal
    Then process "git" is running within 10 seconds
    When I verify the SSH fingerprint for the Git repository
    And process "git" has stopped running after at most 180 seconds
    Then the Git repository "testing" has been cloned successfully
