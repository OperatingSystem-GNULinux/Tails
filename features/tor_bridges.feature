Feature: Using Tails with Tor pluggable transports
  As a Tails user
  I want to circumvent censorship of Tor by using Tor pluggable transports
  And avoid connecting directly to the Tor Network

  Background:
    Given I have started Tails from DVD without network and logged in with bridge mode enabled
    And I capture all network traffic
    When the network is plugged
    Then the Tor Launcher autostarts
    And the Tor Launcher uses all expected TBB shared libraries

  Scenario: Using bridges
    When I configure some bridge pluggable transports in Tor Launcher
    Then Tor is ready
    And available upgrades have been checked
    And all Internet traffic has only flowed through the configured pluggable transports

  Scenario: Using obfs4 pluggable transports
    When I configure some obfs4 pluggable transports in Tor Launcher
    Then Tor is ready
    And available upgrades have been checked
    And all Internet traffic has only flowed through the configured pluggable transports
