# There are two main points to this script:
#   * restarting Tor if bootstrapping stalls for more than 20 seconds
#   * making sure that if vidalia is running it is restarted if Tor is restarted.
#     This is needed because Vidalia doesn't re-connect to Tor automatically,
#     so the user has to restart it to be able to control Tor again. Also, any
#     options  set by Vidalia will be lost since they weren't written to torrc.
